# Example config for a Named Tunnel serving multiple hostnames
# Requires a created tunnel (e.g., name: home-origin) and a credentials JSON file.

# Either the tunnel name (if a matching credentials file exists) or UUID.
tunnel: home-origin

# In-container path to the credentials file (mount it via docker-compose)
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/credentials.json

ingress:
  # All three domains point to the same PHP site (this repo)
  - hostname: stevenwerner.me
    service: http://web:80
  - hostname: stevenwerner.name
    service: http://web:80
  - hostname: stevenwernercs.com
    service: http://web:80

  # Additional sites (start these services on the same Docker network)
  - hostname: cognifiq.dev
    service: http://cognifiq:80   # placeholder service name
  - hostname: infinitecraftgraph.com
    service: http://infinitecraftgraph:3000

  # Optional: serve static files directly from cloudflared (mount folder into container)
  # - hostname: static.example.com
  #   service: file:///sites/static

  # Catch-all must be last
  - service: http_status:404
