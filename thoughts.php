		Take this very moment, pause time, rewind it back 10 seconds, and press play again. Give all conscious beings the ability to remake the previous few decisions and actions. <br/>
		Would, or even could, there be any differences 10 seconds later when we get back to our starting point?
	  </p>
          <p>
		A more tangible thought experiment: <br/>
		Flip a coin. First, rummage around to find a coin. Perch it on your bent fingers with your thump poised under it, and let your thump spring upward and watch the coin rise and fall to the ground. Heads...<br/>
		Now rewind time to just before you started looking for the coin, and play it forward. Internally your brain is in the exact same state as it was the first time. You know nothing about the rewind and believe this is your first attempt. All of your cells in your entire body are in the same state. All of your neurotransmitters are all at the same place in the same quantities, neurons all at the same charges. Exteriorly the coin is at the same place. Everything about the room is the same, the air with the same immensely complex arranged stack of molecules, the speed of those molecules, temperature, and all background noise, frequency pulses traveling through the air that could negligibly effect the coin outcome is the exact same. Even the most minute fluctuations of gravity negligibly acting on the molecules in the air is the same, due to the same arrangement of molten magma churning 1800 miles under you is the same, every conceivable aspect of existence that could alter that coin flip is the same. <br/>
		What about this same exact input, could result in a different output? Your attention on the coin has just the same amount of distractions as it did before, same thoughts were racing in your mind leading up to our pressing play in time from the rewound point.

		If all there is in nature and nurture, then with the same exact nature and nurture you get the same exact human.

          <p>
		If I was born into your body, and raised in your place with your care-givers, I believe I would have no ability not to turn out like you in every way. With the same biology, and the exact same initial life experiences, I believe I would develop the same thoughts have the same actions/reactions.
		<br/>
		I use the same reasoning above to justify this claim as well

          <p class="lead">
		I was asked once, while on a court witness stand, why I was an Atheist... 
	  </p>
	  <p>
		I failed to adequately explain. It seemed like such a ridiculous question with countless small reasons that I couldn't drum up one good one on the spot.<br/>
		I should have said, "Because I read the whole Bible, in context, and analyzed it critically", that would maybe be my main most tangible reason. But I stuttered and stumbled; faltered while thinking the smug self important lawyer talking to me is too blind to see how ridiculous the question was.<br/>
		My answer, while still a legitimate answer to the physical question asked, it was not the answer to the question intended. "Be cause I don't believe in Gods.", knowing full well the definition was known to all in the room, but was a passable success of ending my apparent speechlessness. My own utterance added to my confoundment of the situation, I looked incredulously at the smug self assured lawyer and was annoyed at his gull to ask. And even more annoyed by his seemingly proud accomplished reception of my confusion. I'm sure being a dick is its own discipline in law school.<br/>
		Troubling thing was that it was a question I have longed to answer anyone that would pretend to listen. Warmly thought of as one of my old throw back topics, one that I believe I've settled with myself years ago. But at <i>that</i> moment I was unprepared, more focused on being selected as a jurer than to pour out my ideas on the futility of metaphysics. 
			<blockquote>
				I wanted the opportunity to see a real court case. To prove to myself that I could have been a better laywer then the smug face prosecutor. It was a double homicide going for the death penalty. Capital punishment, as described to me was in Texas, and for this case, was the murdering of more than one people during the same criminal transaction. If evidence says guilty I would at least paint the second killing as self defense making it not murder, and thus no death penalty. I was really curious be on the jury, and to see the process and the final outcome.<br/>
				I wasn't selected.
			</blockquote>
		Mr. Smug did at least afford me the opportunity to rebase myself, only to afford himself the ability to try and poke holes into my beliefs I quickly assumed. I did at least proceeded to say something along the lines of ~"Physics is the only omnipresent undifyable law that governs all things in existence, if people want to call that God sure, but they usually end up falsely attaching (more often then not self serving) interpretations of reasons for events instead accepting that physics is just a set of unfeeling laws"~. The topic changed, and most of the encounter is deep in the recesses of my untrustworthy human memory. 
		<br/>That said; I felt the need, after that fumbling attempt to explain what has become to me the most obvious truth, to structure and formalize my thoughts. And still haven't done so, but plan to place them here when I get around to it.

		  I would like every element of crime management to be accountable for their own domain, while simultaneously benefiting from the positive progress of each of the other elements. If everyone is playing by the rules everyone benefits. The goal would be to create a system that aligns the goals of each element toward the common goal of safety, justice, peace and prosperity. Meaning that the goals of educators, police, first responders, hospitals, detectives, prosecutors, courts, and correction facilities all have their own mutually exclusive goals that work together toward the common goal of an ideal society. While encouraging other element not to cut corners because it only negatively effects themselves and the other elements. This separation of concerns attempt to address issues with our school-to-prison pipeline as it exists today, as well as eliminate the incentive to create repeat offenders. Bottom line, no one should benefit from the existence of crime, and all elements should be structured in a way that they only benefit when doing their utmost to prevent crime and reform those that do commit crime. 
		</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				<strong>Prisons</strong> should not benefit from the number of inmates or the length of their incarceration.<br/>
				<u>Currently:</u> this leads to prisons encouraging violence to extend sentences as well as incentivize prisons to manufacture repeat offenders, making released convicts more dangerous after leaving prison than when they entered prison.<br/>
				<u>Ideally:</u> Incentives should only encourage the reduction of repeat offenders, and the reduction of sentences through early release due to good behavior and reform. All prisons should find it necessary to maintain out reach programs to aid in the integration of released ex-cons not because it is required but just as another means of reaching their incentivized goals. (and it should not be required)
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Courts (experimental)</strong> justice is supposed to be blind, so why not make it that way... With double blind studies applied to court, attorneys and jury.
				<u>Currently:</u> privileged groups like ruling majority, the wealthy, and or well connected statistically get less time for the same crimes.
				<u>Ideally:</u> the jury, or maybe just focus groups, could instead hear the same court preceding with roles reversed, to identify if the there might have been some bias in the verdict to call for an appeal trial. Instead of the black D- student stealing a bag of chips from the convenience store, it was a white A+ student football quarterback. Changing the details that have no baring on the legality of the situation to distill an honest verdict for the actual crime. The D- student needs the most help, but instead we are 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Prosecutors</strong> should not benefit in any way from the quantity of convictions or sentence length of convictions, or having offered plea bargains accepted.<br/>
				<u>Currently:</u> this leads to a substantial amount of false imprisonment and encourages innocent people to take plea deals rather than face inflated sentences from a corrupt system that just wants to get a conviction regardless of justice.<br/>
				<u>Ideally:</u> Incentives should encourage the absence of repeat offenders, over-turned rulings, mistrials at the fault of law enforcement or prosecution, and exonerations. For all exonerations the state needs to pay back time wrongfully served from the state's prosecution budget which they should allocate money on reserve for this and hope its never used (this excludes exonerations from new technology/techniques unavailable at the time of trial).
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Defense Attorneys</strong>
			  </li>
			  <li>
				<strong>Police</strong> should not benefit from the quantity of arrests, or even convictions. The 'thin blue line' or 'blue wall of silence' codes of police corruption should no longer be tolerated<br/>
				<u>Currently:</u> Specific communities are unfairly targeted to get easy arrests to pad quotas or improve standing.<br/> 
				<u>Ideally:</u> Incentives should encourage the reduction in reported/identified crimes and complaints, traffic accidents and insurance claims, peaceful resolution of disputes, and de-escalation of tense situations. Addressing complaints quantified by call backs and or surveys. Police should be held to higher standards than those they serve and protect, not the opposite. Turning in bad apples should be encouraged and rewarded, bad apples should be prosecuted, resigning should never be a get out of jail free card.
			  </li>

		  For profit prisons should not exist. Their existence only incentivize incarceration and long sentences, irrespective of justice or correction.

		  Merit based waterfall transition release should be standard across the country:
		</li>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				No inmate should be directly released from Maximum security prisons. Maximum should only hold the most violent people. It makes no sense to directly release someone from the most violent population in the US, right out to the general population. Maximum security is expensive, if you have served time while proving to be well behaved you should get sent to a lower security prison that can focus less on safety and in-fighting and more on rehabilitation and education. If you commit crimes while within a prison your security level should be re-evaluated and you should be placed in a higher security level or added work detail otherwise and added time once at Maximum. For every increase in security level time should be added to allow the ability to transition back down to minimum before getting out. If your time is coming to an end and you are still in Maximum security your time gets extended because you have not proven your self to be safe for release into the lower security levels much less the general population. 
			  </li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				Prisons should be publicly ranked by ability to reform inmates. The speed of reform is the average speed for a prison to move inmates to a lower security level. Inmates sent back up the security levels drastically impact the reform speed. Any inmate released then re-incarcerated hurts  the releasing prison's score. The aim is to align the prisons with the desire to reform inmates instead of merely babysit and make money off there existence. Incentives to keep a good ranking include extra state funding to be used at the state's discretion to include wage raises for corrections employees outreach programs and public school educators.
			  </li>
			  <li>
				Police forces should also be publicly ranked by ability to maintain a safe and peaceful jurisdiction. Ranked higher for convictions and decreased reported crimes and insurance claims. Ranked lower for wrongful imprisonment, evidence tampering,
